# EDA-on-healthcare-dataset
This is a exploratory data analysis project on a healthcare dataset. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is an approach that is used to analyze the data and discover trends, patterns, or check assumptions in data with the help of statistical summaries and graphical representations. 
We perform the following steps:
1. Getting Insights About The Dataset
2. Changing Dtype from Object to Datetime
3. Handling Missing Values
4. Data Encoding
